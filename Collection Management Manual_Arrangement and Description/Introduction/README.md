<h1>Introduction to Arrangement and Description</h1>

<p>The Archives Center regards arrangement and description, frequently referred to as processing, as a crucial part of the ecosystem of ethical archival stewardship. Arrangement and description provides users access points to discover and access materials. Even more, this work affords archivists with the information required to sustain and manage collections. We define arrangement and description as all of the iterative labor required for an archivist to properly prepare archival materials for use. A processing archivist:</p>
<ul>
  <li>surveys archival collections and records to determine the provenance, contents, condition, order, and research value of materials;</li>
  <li>evaluates the costs required to arrange and describe material in relation to the determined value;</li>
  <li>creates a project plan to document the outcome of archival surveys and decision making and to outline the archivists’ interventions;</li>
  <li>establishes the arrangement of the collection (either by preserving and documenting the original order or by re-arranging and documenting the new order imposed by the archivist);</li>
  <li>and generates an archival finding aid (frequently referred to as a resource record or generally as description) that conforms to local and national best practices.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>The labor entailed within each step of the workflow is continuously shifting in response to the individual needs of our users and of the archives. User expectations increasingly grow to anticipate changes in the way historical documentation is created and delivered. Processing archivists reciprocate by adapting arrangement and description workflows to support more immediate and in-depth access for archival materials for users and archivists.</p>
<p>These guidelines document the development of these workflows and aim to make this labor transparent for future users and workers.</p>

<h2>Required Tools and Access Points</h2>
 
<p>The Archives Center makes use of specialized software and databases to support and streamline the arrangement and description process. Processing archivists require access to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>ArchivesSpace (required):</b> This software is a digital collection management system that can be accessed via website at www.archives.ias.edu/staff. First-time users will require a log-in and password.</li>
  <li><b>ArchiveIT (optional, required for web-based content):</b> This software is used to capture and preserve web-based materials. Access is required for key information required to describe and provide access to web-based acquisitions. The system can be accessed via website, but first-time users will require a log-in and password.</li> 
  <li><b>Preservica (optional, required for born-digital content):</b> This software is used to ingest and preserve born-digital content. Access is required for key information required to describe and access born-digital materials. The system can be accessed via website, but first-time users will require a log-in and password.</li>
 </ul>
<p>In addition to digital tools for creating archival resource records, processing archivists will require access to key resources for identifying archival materials, noting preservation needs, and creating extensible records that conform to local and national standards for best practice. Additional resources include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Describing Archives: A Content Standard (required):</b>  The Society of American Archivists maintains this set of national best-practices for the arrangement and description of archival materials. The standard can be accessed online at: https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/.</li>
<li><b>International Standard for Archival Description (optional):</b>  The International Council of Archives (ICA) maintains this set of international best-practices for the arrangement and description of archival materials. The standard can be accessed online at: https://www.ica.org/en/isadg-general-international-standard-archival-description-second-edition.</li>
<li><b>Authorized Linked Data Service (required):</b>  The Library of Congress Linked Data Service is the preferred online database to support the creation of authorized, linkable agent and subject data for archival records. This database can be accessed online at: www.id.loc.gov. Where no suitable Library of Congress authorities exist, archivists may additionally create authorities using the Virtual International Authority Files (VIAF) database at: www.viaf.org. Alternately, archvists may consult archives specific authority database like Social Networks and Archival Context (SNAC) at: www.snaccooperative.org.</li>
<li><b>Wikidata Linked Data Service (optional):</b>  This online database supports the creation of linkable agent and subject data for archival records. Note that while Wikidata is not considered an “authorized” source by national best practices, its vast controlled vocabulary can be linked to authorized sources and to wiki-content to significantly expand accessibility of archival records. This database can be accessed online at: www.wikidata.org.</li>
<li><b>Collection Identification Guide:</b>  This guide created by the Preservation Self-Assessment Program allows archivist a variety of tools to identify and preserve analog and audiovisual media types. This guide can be accessed at: https://psap.library.illinois.edu/collection-id-guide.</li>
<li><b>PREMIS Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata:</b>  The PREMIS Data Dictionary is the international standard to support the preservation of digital archival materials. This guide can be accessed at: https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/v3/premis-3-0-final.pdf.</li>
<li><b>Housing and Material Specifications Guide:</b>  This guidance from the National Archives provides guidance for archivists on how to stabilize and address preservation storage needs for archival materials. The guidelines can be accessed at: https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/specs-housing-exhibition-2015-current.html.</li>
<li><b>Archival Supplies and Containers:</b>  Archival supplies are available in the HS-LIB 0005 and in the Archives Center Reading Room for general use. Specialized supplies can also be ordered on demand.</li>

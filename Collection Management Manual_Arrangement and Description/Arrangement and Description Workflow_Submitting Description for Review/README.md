<h1>Arrangement and Description Workflows: Submitting Description for Review and Publication</h1>
<p>After saving all descriptive content to the ArchivesSpace resource record, the archivist will submit their finding aid for peer-review. The peer-review process promotes accountability among archivists and provides an opportunity for feedback and revision.</p>
<p>Once the finding aid is reviewed and any edits amended, the ArchivesSpace system administrator will publish the finding aid for public view completing the arrangement and description process. At this point, all that remains is for the archivist to file all of the documentation created during the arrangement and description workflow in the collection folder and optionally update the collection management record for the collection in ArchivesSpace.</p>

<h1>Arrangement and Description Workflows: Creating a Project Plan for Arrangement and Description</h1>
<p>Before arrangement and description work can begin, archivists will create a Project Plan to outline the proposed plan for arrangement and description. The Project Plan is a critical step in the workflow as it is the only point in which outside archivists can review and offer feedback on the proposed course of action. This step promotes collaboration and accountability in the stewardship of the record. Additionally, the completed project plan becomes a helpful tool for the archivist to outline the course of their work and document archival interventions for future archivists and users alike.</p>
<p>The Project Plan records all of the work completed in the collection survey and analysis as well as the evaluation of labor costs. All plans will follow the same format as adapted from the OCLC’s "Total Cost of Stewardship" report.</p>

<h3><b>COLLECTION SURVEY + ANALYSIS</b></h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
<p>Create a brief overview of the collection’s context and contents. Include relevant information about the creator as well as the context of creation (i.e., what actions or activities the collection documents). Also include a high-level description of the materials in the collection, including general information about the types of materials included. Try to be brief (no more than 250 words).</p>
 
<p><b>Custodial History</b></p>
<p>Describe the chain of custody for the materials, including information regarding collection ownership, storage, and/or any interventions involved in the collection in its current state. Identify if the collection came in one accession or multiple additions/accruals.</p>
 
<p><b>Arrangement</b></p>
<p>Detail the existing arrangement of the collection. Explain if the collection’s original order remains intact and/or any interventions to the order that have been imposed prior. If no order exists, note that as well.</p>
 
<p><b>Format Needs</b></p>
<p>Identify any specialized formats present in the collection. Include information about audiovisual materials, born-digital materials, or three-dimensional artifacts that may require specialized storage and/or condition assessments.</p>
 
<p><b>Condition Assessment</b></p>
<p>Provide relevant details regarding the condition of the collection. Include any major preservation concerns (e.g., water damage, pest infestation, and/or active mold.) Identify if the collection requires re-housing and detail any supplies that will be needed to stabilize the collection’s condition prior to long-term storage.</p>

<p><b>Rights and Restrictions</b></p>
<p>Identify if collection contains any protected contents (i.e., student records protected under FERPA or health records protected under HIPAA); any sensitive contents (e.g., personal identifying information, financial records, or culturally sensitive materials); and/or any materials that have been restricted per the terms of the deed of gift or acquisition. Identify if there is any information about the copyright for the collection contents and/or any relevant information about the intellectual property as a whole.</p>
 
<h3><b>PROPOSED PLAN OF ACTION</b></h3>
 
<p><b>Proposed Accessibility Level for Arrangement and Description:</b></p>
<p><b>Estimated Hours of Labor:</b></p>
<p><b>Estimated Costs:</b></p>
 
<p><b>Proposed Arrangement</b></p>
<p>If the archivist plans to impose a new arrangement on the collection, provide a detailed outlined of the new arrangement including titles, dates, and extents for each series/sub-series. For folder-level or item-level accessibility, be sure to provide a brief justification of the chosen approach. If the arrangement will remain as is, no justification is needed.</p>
 
<p><b>Proposed Housing and Stabilization Work</b></p>
<p>Provide a brief overview of any physical rehousing and/or arrangement required to complete the project. Include an estimate of the required supplies needed to complete that work, being sure to include any specialized supplies that will be required (e.g., cassette boxes, oversized boxes, etc.).</p>
 
<p><b>Proposed Weeding and Appraisal</b></p>
<p>If the collection contains excessive  duplicates, sensitive materials, and/or  non-archival materials that should be removed from the collection during processing, indicate what those materials are and provide an appropriate course of action (e.g., duplicates should be removed and recycled, sensitive materials should be removed and reviewed by donor, etc.).</p>
 
<p><b>Proposed Work for Specialized Formats</b></p>
<p>If the collection contains audiovisual or born-digital materials that require specialized housing or transfer to special storage environments, outline a course of action for that work here.</p>
 
<p><b>Proposed Preservation/Conservation Work</b></p>
<p>If the collection requires preservation or conservation, indicate the needs and a proposed course of action. Note that preservation and conservation will exclude preventative or “holdings maintenance” work  and focus instead on major interventions (e.g., de-acidification, repair, encapsulation, etc.).</p>
 
<p><b>Proposed Timeline</b></p>
<p>Provide an overview of the actions you will take in order. Include any milestones or deliverables that can be shared with relevant stakeholders or community members.</p>

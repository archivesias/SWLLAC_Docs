<h1>Arrangement and Description Workflows: Generating a Finding Aid</h1>  
<p>After finalizing the collection’s arrangement, archivists finalize their work by completing the collection’s description. Archival description acts as an important access tool for users navigating the collection. The description itself is often conflated with the finding aid or resource record. However, it’s important for archivists to recognize the difference.</p>
<p>Archival description is simply that: text that an archivist creates to describe a collection. Description can be saved as documentation in a word document, a pdf, or even just a typed/manuscript note saved in a collection file. In order to make archival description convenient and accessible for our users, archivists standardize description using best practices (DACS and/or ISAD-G), so that archival description across multiple repositories looks similar and users know generally how to interact with it. Additionally, archivists compile our description into standardized tools, “finding aids,” which are often made available digitally to help users navigate collections from afar. Finally, archivists often create and maintain our finding aids in a specialized encoded format (Encoded Archival Description or EAD) that allows archives to aggregate and preserve collection description in mass.</p>
<p>During processing, the archivist will use the collection management software (ArchivesSpace) to create a resource record that can be automatically exported as an EAD file for aggregation and preservation by collection stewards. Using ArchivesSpace, the archivist can publish their resource record to the web where it will appear as one of many finding aids in our digital database for users to browse, search, and request materials from afar.</p> 
<p>The following rules ensure the consistency and usability of this resource record as data. It is crucial for archivists to use the below charts to record data for each sub-record or part of the resource record, so that both users and future archivists can leverage their efforts for years to come.</p>

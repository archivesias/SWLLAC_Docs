<h1>Arrangement and Description Workflows: Evaluating the Time and Costs of Stewardship</h1>
<p>After completing a detailed survey and analysis of the collection’s context of creation, contents, and condition, the processing archivist will need to complete one final evaluation before composing a final recommendation for the collection’s arrangement and description. This final step consists of an evaluation of the total time and costs affiliated with the work to be proposed in the processing plan.</p>
<p>As the OCLC’s "Total Costs of Stewardship: Responsible Collection Building in Archives and Special Collections" report explains, “A key to making informed collection development, appraisal, and collection management decisions is a strong understanding of the necessary institutional resources and capacity for the work to preserve, describe, store, and make accessible collection materials. But in many institutions, those tasked with building collections are separate from those tasked with the ongoing stewardship work of collections. Because of this operational divide, institutions may lack clear, timely, and actionable information on the institution’s capacity to care for its collections, making a holistic approach to acquisition, appraisal, and stewardship decisions especially challenging.” The final evaluation of the costs of stewardship helps to bridge this gap by asking all archivists that participate in collection maintenance to consider how the costs associated with a single collection can comprise or affect the capacity of the Archives Center to care for the collections as a whole.</p>
<p>After the survey and analysis of the collection, the archivist can make informed decisions about how to arrange and describe material at a level that increases the collection’s accessibility to users responsibly (i.e., without draining the institutional capacity). One way that archivists can frame this work is by considering the life cycle of the collection. Ideally, archival collections outlive their stewards; responsible stewards recognize that there will be generations of archivists that continually provide additional care to extend the accessibility of the collection over the course of its lifecycle.  Responsible archivists understand that arrangement and description is an iterative process: a single collection will likely be arranged and described multiple times over generations as user expectations and collection maintenance expectations change.</p>   
<p>In order to facilitate iterative (or extensible) arrangement and description, many archivists choose to describe arrangement and description projects based on a framework that acknowledge progressive levels of stewardship. The “levels” in the framework represent the collection’s accessibility by isolating progressively smaller parts of the collection to determine if those intellectual or physical of its hierarchy are arranged, described, and available to researchers. These levels generally include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The “collection-level” (e.g., the collection as a whole is described and users can request the entire collection but not individual boxes, folders, or items);</li>
  <li>the “series-level” (e.g., the collection has individual series or sub-groups that are described and that users can request as a single series of the collection);</li>
  <li>the “container-level” (e.g., the collection’s individual containers are described and users can request a single box in a series or collection);</li>
  <li>the “folder-level” (e.g, the collection’s folders are described and users can request an individual folder in a container, series, or collection);</li>
  <li>or the “item-level” (e.g., each individual item is described and users can request the a given item in a folder, box, series, or collection)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each level of accessibility requires an increasing amount of labor for archivists arranging and describing collections and is therefore more expensive in terms of labor associated costs. In order for archivists to evaluate costs effectively, our institution maintains the below guidelines to help determine the costs of labor and supplies associated with each level.</p>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Collection-Level</td>
  <td>Archivists leave the collection in its existing order/arrangement. If the collection is not housed in archival containers, archivists will rehouse materials and check for preservation concerns, but will not re-house individual folders. Archivists will move labeled storage containers to storage for later work.</td>
  <td>Archivists will create a resource record in ArchivesSpace that conforms to DACS’ single-level minimum for archival description. Archivists will additionally conduct a general survey of the collection to identify any special formats (e.g., audiovisual materials, born digital materials, three-dimensional artifacts) and record any access or use restrictions that may apply based on format or collection contents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Series-Level</td>
  <td>Archivists will put the collection into a rough order based on intellectual groupings. If the collection is not housed in archival containers, archivists will rehouse materials and check for preservation concerns. Archivists will place loose materials into folders and remove any binders, hanging file folders, or frames that prevent proper long-term storage.</td>
  <td>Archivists will create a resource record in ArchivesSpace that conforms to DACS’ single-level minimum for archival description and includes identified series. Archivists will create scope and content notes for each series and/or sub-series that describe the contents and add an arrangement note to the collection-level finding aid.
Archivists will create a collection inventory that identifies which containers include content for each series. Archivists will additionally note the presence of any restricted content and/or special formats.</td>  
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>File-Level</td>
  <td>Put series and folders or volumes in order within boxes. Do not order or arrange material within folders. If arrives unfoldered: Items identified, roughly sorted and placed into folders. Materials rehoused into archival boxes; refoldering into archival folders only if originals are damaged or do not fit; Check for mold, pests and nitrate film.</td>
  <td>Collection-Level record and finding aid with folder list.</td>
</tr> 
<tr>
  <td>Item-Level</td>
  <td>Materials rehoused into archival boxes, items refoldered into archival folders. Individual items arranged within folders or individually foldered.</td>
  <td>Collection-Level record and detailed finding aid with a container list that lists individual items.</td>

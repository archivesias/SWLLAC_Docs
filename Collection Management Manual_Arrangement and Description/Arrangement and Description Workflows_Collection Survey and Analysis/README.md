<h1>Arrangement and Description Workflows: Collection Survey and Analysis</h1>
<p>Archivists begin the work of arrangement and description with a detailed survey of the archival collection in its entirety. The collection survey begins with an archivist identifying all administrative records related to the acquisition, accession, and maintenance of the collection to the present day.</p>
 
<p>This workflow begins with a review of the collection folder (sometimes called control folder). This folder may be electronic or analog, but either way it should contain all of the documentation the archives maintains about the material’s acquisition, accession, preservation, and maintenance of the collection. Frequently, these folders contain correspondence with the source/creator of the collection, legal documentation of the acquisition, accession records for the first donation and any subsequent additions, inventories of the collection contents, and condition/preservation assessments of the materials.</p>
 
<p>After consulting the collection folder, the processing archivist should additionally consult the Archives Center’s collection management software. The archivist should review all relevant records in ArchivesSpace concerning the collection, including resource records, accession records, digital object records, and location records.</p>
 
<p>Finally, once the archivist acquires the location information for the collection and any additions, they can begin a review of the physical contents of the collection. As the archivist reviews the documentation and surveys materials, they will ensure that they have the relevant information needed to create a comprehensive processing plan. The information in the survey checklist below provides a general guideline for the kinds of information that archivists will need to do so.</p>

<h2>Arrangement and Description Worksheet: Quick Guide to Collection Survey and Analysis</h2>
<p><b>Collection Creation</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Which person or group of people is responsible for the creation/accumulation of these materials?</li>
  <li>In what context did that person or group collect these materials? (Did that person collect materials over the course of their personal life? over the course of their employment? alongside their family or kinfolk?)</li>
  <li>Is the person that created the materials the same person that donated the materials? If not, how did the donor come into possession of these materials?</li>
  <li>Is there a single donation of materials or were there multiple donations? If multiple, does the archives documentation accurately reflect all donations?</li>
  <li>Is there anything we do not know about the collection’s creation, ownership, and transfer to the archive?</li>
 </ul>
<p><b>Collection Contents</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the total size of the collection?</li>
  <li>What formats are included among the collection contents? Is there born-digital, web content, or audiovisual materials that require additional consideration processing workflows?</li>
  <li>Are there any preservation or condition concerns in the collection?</li>
  <li>Are there any materials that contain sensitive or restricted contents?</li>
  <li>What dates does the material cover? What significant individuals or subjects?</li>
 </ul>
<p><b>Collection Arrangement and Existing Description</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Does the collection have an existing or original order? If, so is the existing order sufficient to provide users with access to the collection?</li>
  <li>Are there any existing inventories or navigational tools to help users navigate the collection? If so, are these tools accurate?</li>
  <li>What is the current level of accessibility (or level of control) for the collection? Can a user request the collection as a whole, individual series/sub-groups, individual boxes, individual folders, and/or individual items?</li>
  <li>Are there any digitized surrogates that provide digital access to the collection contents?</li>
</ul>

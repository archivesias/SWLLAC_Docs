<h1>Guidelines for Transferring Institute Records</h1>
<p>The Shelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center provides a key connection between the Institute for Advanced Study and the broader public. By making the historic archives of the Institute available, we support the public’s ability to discover and engage with the historic community of scholars at the heart of the Institute’s mission.  As part of this work, we collect, preserve, and provide access to the records that document the Institute’s historic activities, including the work of Institute administrators, scholars, and staff.</p> 
<p>We welcome records from all departments and offices within the Institute regardless of format; however, given the vast amount of records created across the Institute each day, we strive to select only the approximately 5% of records created within a given institution that demonstrate an enduring value to our community. In order to assist staff, the Archivist offers in person consultation and appraisal of Institute records. For those who wish to evaluate records independently, we offer the following guidelines for evaluating Institute records.</p>  

<h2>Evaluating Institute Records</h2>
<p>When evaluating records for transfer to the Archives Center, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do these records document the impact of this department’s or school’s mission and/or its role within the broader community? Do these records illustrate changes in how we understand our work or its significance?</li>
<li>Are these records considered no longer useful by our department and/or school? Do we no longer require access to these materials to conduct our routine work? If the materials are governed by a local retention schedule, have they passed the period of retention and disposition?</li> 
<li>Are these records considered to be the intellectual property of the Institute according to guidelines outlined in the Institute Intellectual Property Policy?</li> 
<li>Is this office the creator and owner of these records (rather than the holder of additional and/or reference copies)?</li>
<p>If you answer yes to any of the above questions, the records should be considered for transfer to the archives. If you require additional assistance, consult the Archivist.</p> 
</ul>

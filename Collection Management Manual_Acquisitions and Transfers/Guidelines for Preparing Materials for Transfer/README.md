<h1>Guidelines for Preparing Materials for Transfer</h1>
<p>The Archives Center relies upon our partners to help us preserve our communityâ€™s history. We appreciate immensely the help of our individual partners in evaluating and preparing materials for transfer to the archives. The following checklist should help guide individuals as they prepare their materials:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Archival materials should be reviewed for house-keeping. Individual creators should make use of the Basic Inventory Template to create a list of files being transferred. Additionally, creators should do a quick sweep to ensure that there are no materials that contain no archival content and would need to be deleted/disposed.</li> 
<li>Archival materials should be prepared for transit. All physical items should be placed in standard archival boxes with the hard copies of the inventory inside. Oversize should be separated and contained wherever possible. Audiovisual materials should be titled wherever possible to provide key details about their content.  All digital files should include a digital copy of an inventory and should be scanned for viruses.</li>
<li>All materials should be labeled.</li> 
</ul>
<p>
Archival boxes should be labeled with the following details: 
<ul>  
<li>Name and Address of Creator</li> 
<li>Institutional Department (Records Only)</li> 
</li> Box Number</li> 
</ul>
<p>An example might look as follows: 
	</lb>Caitlin Rizzo (1 Einstein Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540)
	</lb>Shelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center
	</lb>Box 1 of 5
</p>
<p>Digital files should be labeled with meaningful file titles that include the following details:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name of Creator/Institutional Department (Records Only)</li>
  <li>Content</li>
  <li>File Extension</li>
</ul>
<p>An example might look as follows: HSSSLibrary_DEITaskForceMinutes.pdf.</p></p>

<p>The Archives Center should be notified that materials are in transit. The Archives Center will ensure that materials are transferred and received as soon as they arrive and will promptly inform you of their receipt; we only ask that you let us know to expect their arrival.</p> 

<p>If you have any additional questions or require additional support, please contact the Archives Center at archives@ias.edu. We are happy to be of assistance!</p>

<h1>Methods of Acquisition</h1>
<p>The Shelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center currently accepts and acquires collections through the following methods:</p> 
<ul>
<li><b>Transfer:</b> In line with the Institute’s Intellectual Property Policy, we support the transfer of records created and accumulated by administration and individual employees over the course of their employment with the Institute. Inactive records of historic value are transferred to the archives with approval from the Institute’s Archivist. </li>	
<li><b>Donation:</b> The Archives Center accepts donations in line with the goals stated in the Collection Development Policy. The Archivist is responsible for coordinating and approving the terms of gifts.</li> 
<li><b>Purchase:</b> The Archives Center very rarely acquires collection materials from private individuals and/or organizations with the support of the Institute Historical Studies-Social Sciences Library. In these cases, the Archivist is responsible for coordinating with the HS-SS Library Acquisitions Librarian to procure materials.</li>
<li><b>Post-Custodial Collecting:</b> The Archives Center remains committed to making use of post-custodial collecting strategies that leverage archival technologies to assist in preservation and stewardship while leaving a collection within its community. The Archivist provides consultation and assistance on post-custodial collecting projects on a case-by-case basis.</li> 
<li><b>Web Archiving:</b> The Archives Center leverages the Internet Archive’s ArchiveIT technology to provide web archiving support for institutional and individual websites only with the express consent of creators. The Archivist coordinates appraisal, selection, and archiving of web content on a case by case basis.</li>
</ul>

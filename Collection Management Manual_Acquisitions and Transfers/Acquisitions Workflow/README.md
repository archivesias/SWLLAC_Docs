<h1>Acquisitions Workflow</h1>
<p>Regardless of the method of acquisition, the workflow for acquisition will generally follow the standardized steps as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Institutional/Community Creator identifies materials as being of enduring value. Either Archivist or Creator initiates conversations around acquisition.</li>
<li>Archivist works with Creators to evaluate materials and assess the costs/impacts of acquisition.</li> 
<li>Archivists and Creators compile formal agreement. For Institutional Creators, this will be the Transfer Request Form. For Community Creators, this will be either a Deed of Gift or Memorandum of Understanding.</li> 
<li>Archivist provides Creators with Guidelines for Preparing Materials for Transfer to Archives and Basic Inventory Template. Creators work with Archivist to ensure materials are ready for transfer of custody.</li> 
<li>Materials transfer custody. Physical materials are sent to the archive. Digital materials are transferred according to the guidance of the Digital Collections Archivist.</li> 
<li>Archivist accepts materials by sending a Receipt of Transfer Template to Institutional Creators or an Acknowledgement Letter to Community Creators.</li> 
<li>Archivist compiles all acquisition documentation for the control folder and places the digital control folder on a shared network drive. Any physical materials are placed in the Accessioning Hold Room to await formal Accession and Storage.</li> 
</ol>

<h1>Guidelines for Evaluating Materials of Enduring Value</h1>
<p>The following guidelines for evaluating materials of enduring value have been adopted from the OCLCâ€™s Total Cost of Stewardship Research. For every acquisition, the Archivist will either informally or formally work through all of the guidelines below to determine the feasibility of acquiring a given set of materials. </p>

<h2>Determining Research and Institutional Value</h2>
<ul>
<li>How does this acquisition support the mission of the Archives Center?</li>
<li>How do these materials relate to the stated goals and strengths in the Collection Development Policy?</li> 
<li>Does this collection document historically marginalized communities and/or address gaps or weaknesses in the collection?</li>
<li>Who are the anticipated audiences for this acquisition? How will those audiences use this material?</li>
<li>Is this material largely unique or unavailable to this audience elsewhere? Do other repositories have holdings that duplicate or better complement this material?</li>
<li>How does this acquisition relate to the existing holdings in our collection? Are there statistics to help support the demonstrated use of these existing holdings?</li>
</ul>
<h2>etermining Value for Connections, Collaborations, and Community Building</h2>
<ul>
<li>Does this collection have any ties to other repositories? Is it part of a larger collection held by another institution? If so, have those institutions been offered this material?</li> 
<li>Does this collection require partnerships with other institutions or communities to steward responsibly? If so, have we explored the feasibility of supporting these partnerships over time?</li> 
<li>Does this collection present opportunities for connecting with communities that we hope to engage? If so, are there ways that we can acquire this material that support that community and/or their connection to the material either (via exhibition, digitization, or cultivation)?</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Determining Collection Needs</h2>
<ul>
<li>How was this material created, assembled, and used by the creators? Are the creators actively using these materials?</li>	 
<li>What functions, actions, or activity did this material support or enable?</li>	 
<li>What is the custodial history of the collection? Do the creators own this material?</li>	 
<li>Is the material currently housed, arranged, and/or filed in a way that supports its use by the creator? If so, can the creator explain the arrangement?</li>	 
<li>How large is this collection? What portions of this collection are candidates for acquisition? What portions should not be acquired?</li>	
<li>What formats are included in this collection (and in what amount)? Are there born-digital files, audiovisual items, and/or large amounts of print/published material that require cataloging?</li>	 
<li>What is the current condition of the collection? Are there any major preservation concerns?</li>	
</ul>

<h2>Determining Rights and Restriction Needs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Will there be any restrictions on this material? Are those restrictions actionable and time- bound? Are restricted materials already separated or easy to identify?</li>
<li>Is the material under copyright? What percentage of copyrighted material was created by the donor/seller? Is the donor/seller planning on licensing material under a creative commons license, licensing them to the repository, or signing copyright over to the repository?</li>
<li>Does the born-digital material have a high likelihood of containing personally identifiable information (PII)?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Determining Existing Capacity</h2>
<ul>
<li>How long will the material take to process or catalog?</li>
<li>How does this rank in terms of existing cataloging or processing priorities?</li>
<li>Would this acquisition change those current priorities or divert staff or other resources from existing planned priorities?</li>
<li>Are current staffing levels, storage spaces, and available equipment and workspaces sufficient to meet the needs of this collection? Are there any timelines, deadlines, or other contingencies that need to be met for this acquisition to move forward?</li>
<li>Does this acquisition demand significant resources from other units or campus partners (digitization, conservation, etc.) and can they provide those resources?</li>
</ul>

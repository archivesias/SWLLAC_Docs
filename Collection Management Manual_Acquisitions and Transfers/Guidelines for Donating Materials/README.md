<h1>Guidelines for Donating Materials </h1>
<p>The Shelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center collects the work of Institute scholars who have made significant contributions to their respective fields and/or a broader, global community. In addition, we welcome the collections of scholars whose work aligns with the subject strengths and areas of acquisition prioritized in the Shelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center’s Collection Development Policy. </p>
<p>We note that this includes an effort to collect the work of scholars whose voices have been structurally and systemically marginalized by the historic practices of archives. We actively seek to repair these historic harms by working with historically-marginalized creators to consider donations in ways that support and affirm their work.</p> 

<h2>Evaluating Personal Collections</h2>
<p>When evaluating personal collections for transfer to the Archives Center, scholars should the following questions:</p> 
<ul>
  <li>Do these materials document the impact of this scholar’s work and research in a global  community?</li> 
  <li>Will these materials be of enduring use to future generations of researchers and scholars in the field?</li> 
  <li>Does this material document other significant communities and individuals related to your work in a way that speaks to a wider network of scholarship?</li> 
</ul>
<p>If you answer yes to any of the above questions, these materials should be considered for donation to the archives. If you require additional assistance, please contact the Archivist for assistance.</p>

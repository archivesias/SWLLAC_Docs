<h1>Introduction</h1> 
<p>The Shelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center serves as an institutional home for collective memory at the Institute for Advanced Study. We welcome researchers and interested individuals from across the world into the Institute for Advanced Study to engage with the material legacy of the scholars who have found refuge on the Institute grounds.</p>
<p>We serve the broader mission of the Institute for Advanced Study by supporting research that seeks to “push beyond” the limitations of the past and look forward to the future of advanced scholarship. We document, collect, and sustain the history of our Institute and Faculty and provide a pathway for those who might ‘carry on’ the intellectual endeavors of our scholars. For those outside of the academic community, we provide equitable access and inclusive programming that demonstrates the value of advanced research to a global community.</p> 

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This Collection Development Policy was created by the Archivist at the Institute for Advanced Study in order to: 
<ul>
  <li>	outline the positionality and values that guide our collecting and stewardship practices transparently for both the creators and potential users of our collections;</li>
  <li>	establish the history and scope of our collection to create a sustainable basis for ethical maintenance and development of our holdings; and</li>
  <li>	identify the communities of individuals and institutions whose histories and whose futures are bound to our collections and our collecting practices moving forward.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Guiding Values</h2>
<p>The Shelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center is committed to collecting practices that affirm the value and dignity of the individuals who create, claim, and engage with the historic collections we sustain. We acknowledge that collecting practices can be wielded as a hegemonic tool to establish which histories must be valued and sustained and which histories can be discarded and erased, and additionally which individuals hold the power to manage and authorize historic facts.  In adopting these guiding values, we hope to address structural injustices which inevitably result from collecting in ways that are primarily extractive and exploitative of creators, users, and communities impacted by the archives.</p> 

<p>Our values are as follows.
<ol>
<li>We respect the agency and autonomy of the individuals who create collections in the broadest sense. We recognize a definition of ‘creator,’ in line with archival standards, that extends to those who create and accumulate materials as well as to archival workers themselves. At the same time, we acknowledge that this may be an inadequate framework that elides the accumulation of property (e.g. ownership) with authorship, sustaining a historic framework that privileges wealth and disenfranchises those who have been displaced and dispossessed. We recognize the agency and autonomy not just of those who ‘create’ collections in a narrow sense but also of those whose work and identity is necessarily imbricated in networks of collecting. We commit to a practice that values the agency, autonomy, and dignity of these individuals and that seeks to destabilize the primacy of property and ownership as the basis for collecting.</li> 

<li>We acknowledge the need for accountable and transparent stewardship practices. As archivists, we understand that stewardship and maintenance are not inherently neutral practices. We commit to making our practices open and accessible. We commit to welcoming feedback on our practices and to striving to practice a sustainable and equitable stewardship. </li>

<li>We recognize the right of equitable access as well as the right to personal privacy. We collect materials for the primary purpose of making them available for use; however, we understand that representation and visibility can be at once life-affirming and life-threatening for individuals and communities that have been the target of historic violence. We commit to a collecting practice that strives to provide broad and equitable access in a way that respects personal and collective rights to privacy.</li>

<li>We value collective and collaborative forms of engagement. We acknowledge that there is no single, authoritative form of history but rather as many histoires as individuals that seek to engage them. We welcome collaborative and collective work that strives to provide historical narrative and counter-narrative from many perspectives. Additionally, we prioritize forms of collecting and engagement that respect the historic calls of marginalized communities to create ‘nothing about us, without us.’ </li>

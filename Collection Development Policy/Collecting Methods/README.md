<h1>Collecting Methods</h1>
<p>The Shelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center currently accepts and acquires collections through the following methods:</p> 
<ul>
<li><h2>Transfer</h2>
<p>The Archives Center’s primary mandate is to preserve the history of the Institute for Advanced Study. We welcome and assist in the effort to preserve and provide access to Institutional records. In line with the Institute’s Intellectual Property Policy, we provide consultation and appraisal of Institutional records created and accumulated by Institute administration and individual employees over the course of their employment with the Institute. Inactive records of historic value are transferred to the archives with approval from the Institute’s Archivist. 
</p></li>
<li><h2>Donation</h2>
<p>The Archives Center accepts donations of collections related to the Institute’s Community of Scholars which align with our goals for collection development. The Institute’s Archivist consults with individual donors to ensure that the collection will be stewarded and maintained in a way that is respectful and sustainable. 
</p>
</li>
<li><h2>Purchase</h2>
<p>The Archives Center very rarely acquires collection materials from private individuals and/or organizations with the support of the Institute Historical Studies-Social Sciences Library. In these cases, the Archivist is responsible for ensuring that materials align with stated goals and values for collection development.
</p></li>
<li><h2>Post-Custodial Collecting and Web Archiving</h2>
<p>The Archives Center acknowledges that at times it is undesirable for the archives to remove collections from their original context and communities of creation. In these instances, the Archives Center remains committed to making use of post-custodial collecting strategies that leverage digitization and web-archiving technologies to assist in preservation and stewardship while leaving a collection within its community. The Archivist provides consultation and assistance on post-custodial collecting projects on a case-by-case basis. </p>

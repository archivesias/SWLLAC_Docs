<h1>Collaborations and Partnerships</h1>
<p>The Shelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center prioritizes building and sustaining reciprocal relationships as an integral facet of collection development. In the words of Stephen Lubar, we recognize that good curation “lay[s] a foundation on which others could build,” one that is “[able] to change with the times,” and communicate to its audiences “the value of the collection.” Put simply we strive to build connections within our community as the basis of our collections. </p>

<ul>
<li>Institute for Advanced Study Community of Scholars</li>

<h1>Areas for Strategic Growth and Development</h1>
<p>The Shelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center is invested in fostering strategies for collection development that align with our existing strengths and expand to represent the growth of our community. In the essay “Mutualizing Knowledge, Bridging Differences, Sharing Resources on Collaborative Production” curatorial scholar Lotte Arndt asks “whether it is possible to transform... institutional situations into locations of exchange, productive conflict, and reciprocity” by turning away from traditional principles of collection development and curation to embrace collaborative models. Following this model, the Archives Center has highlighted the following areas in which we are actively seeking partnerships to develop:</p> 
<ul>
<li><h2>Institute Community and Collaboration</h2>
<p>In the Founding mission of the Institute, Founding Director Abraham Flexner writes that the mission of the Institute is to call scholars “to assembly.” The idea of the importance of assembly, or community, is deeply embedded in the history of the Institute for Advanced Study. However, the Archives Center has identified a critical gap around documentation that allows researchers to understand the critical importance of the Institute community as the basis for visionary ideas. 
</p>
<p></p>The Archives Center actively seeks partnerships with individuals and/or groups whose work demonstrates the key role of collaboration and community in advanced scholarship. We welcome materials that document both individual and institutional partnership and we privilege materials that provide unique insight into the lived experiences of creating community both inside and outside of Institute walls.
</p>
</li>
<li><h2>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusivity</h2>
<p>The face of advanced research is increasingly changing to challenge deeply embedded prejudices that have historically enforced hegemonic claims about who is capable of conducting research. As advanced research changes to accept more voices from historically marginalized groups, we are faced with a unique opportunity to tell the stories of both institutional and individual efforts to co-construct a new face of scholarship.</p> 
<p>The Archives Center recognizes that this exclusion has resulted in the erasure of significant bodies of knowledge within the historic record and we are particularly interested in working with individuals seeking to engage the history of diversity and inclusivity in the past, present, and future of the Institute in the broadest sense. In the particular context of the Institute, diverse history includes the history of individuals within our community who identify as: African, African-American, Black, East Asian, Hispanic, Indigenous, Latin American, Middle Eastern, and/or South Asian. This also includes the history of individuals within our community who identify as: disabled, gender-diverse, neurodiverse and/or sexually-diverse.</p>

<h2>Activism and Advanced Research</h2>
<p>The Institute’s Community of Scholars have demonstrated a continual commitment to leveraging their role as public academics and advanced researchers to advocate for the better of society as a whole. From Founding Faculty members like Albert Einstein and Oswald Veblen to contemporary Faculty like Suzanne Akbari and Alondra Nelson, Institute scholars have attempted to integrate scholarship into national and international debates on the public interest.</p> 
<p>The Archives Center is interested in partnerships that support and further these efforts by promoting access to history scholarly activism as well as providing opportunities for new generations of researchers to participate in coalition building around new causes. We welcome materials and collaborations that document the Institute community’s efforts to create better and more sustainable futures.</p> 
</li>
<li>
<h2>Global Impacts</h2>
<p>Institute Faculty, Members, Visitors, and affiliated scholars have historically produced scholarship that fundamentally challenges universally accepted narratives. Our scholars have demonstrated the groundbreaking global impacts of work in a variety of fields.</p> 
<p>The Archives Center seeks to document those projects and efforts which have made fundamental changes to scholarship in the diverse fields represented by the Institute’s distinguished Faculty.</p>

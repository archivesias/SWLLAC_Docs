<h1>Accession Workflows: Store Materials for Long-Term Preservation and Maintenance</h1>  
<p>After the accession record is complete, the last remaining task is to label all containers for long-term storage and assign materials a location. During the stabilization process, archivists should have placed all materials into acid-free containers. The last step in this process is to assign these containers a location in the Archives Centerâ€™ storage areas.</p> 
<p>Once a location is assigned, containers should receive a label with the following details:</p> 
<ul>
  <li>Collection Title</li> 
	<li>Collection Identifier</li>
  <li>(Optional) Accession Identifier</li>
	<li>Box Number</li>
	<li>Assigned Location</li>
	<li>Barcode</li>
</ul>
<p>After the containers are labeled, the materials can be placed in storage, completing the accessioning process.</p>

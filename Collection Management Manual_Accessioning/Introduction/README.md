<h1>Introduction to Accessioning</h1>

<p>The Archives Center regards accessioning as one of the foundations of ethical archival stewardship. Accessioning is the first step in establishing a sustainable life cycle for the maintenance of materials acquired by the archives. We define accessioning as all of the labor required for an archivist to properly prepare new acquisitions for long-term storage and maintenance in the archive. An accessioning archivist: </p>	
<ul>
<li>analyzes new acquisitions to determine their contents and conditions; </li>
<li>stabilizes materials to address immediate threats to their preservation;</li> 
<li>documents the materials by creating a baseline accession record to allow other archivists and researchers access to materials;</li> 
<li>and oversees the materials in a controlled preservation environment in order to ensure and expand their accessibility over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The labor entailed by each of these processes is continuously redefined in response to the changing climate of records creation and use. As the methods by which records are created shift, user expectations increasingly grow to anticipate changes in the way historical documentation is stored and delivered. Accessioning archivists reciprocate by adapting accessioning workflows to support more immediate and in-depth access for archival acquisitions.</p> 

<p>These guidelines document the development of these workflows and make this labor transparent for future archival workers and users.</p>  

<h2>Required Tools and Access Points</h2>

<p>The Archives Center makes use of specialized software and databases to support and streamline the accessioning process. Accessioning archivists require access to the following:</p> 
<ul> <li>ArchivesSpace (required): This software is a digital collection management system that can be accessed via website at www.archives.ias.edu/staff. First-time users will require a log-in and password.</li> 
<li>ArchiveIT (optional, required for web-based content): This software is used to capture web-based acquisitions. Access is required for key information required to accession web-based acquisitions. The system can be accessed via website, but first-time users will require a log-in and password.</li>   
<li>Preservica (optional, required for born-digital content): This software is used to ingest born-digital content acquisitions. Access is required for key information required to accession born-digital materials. The system can be accessed via website, but first-time users will require a log-in and password.</li>   
</ul>
<p>In addition to digital tools for creating accession records, accessioning archivists will require access to key resources for identifying archival materials, stabilizing preservation needs, and creating extensible records that conform to local and national standards for best practice. Additional resources include:</p> 
<ul><li>Authorized Linked Data Service (required): The Library of Congress Linked Data Service is the preferred online database to support the creation of authorized, linkable agent and subject data for archival records. This database can be accessed online at: www.id.loc.gov. Where no suitable Library of Congress authorities exist, archivists may additionally create authorities using the Virtual International Authority Files (VIAF) database at: www.viaf.org. Alternately, Archvists may consult archives specific authority database like Social Networks and Archival Context (SNAC) at: www.snaccooperative.org.</li> 
<li>Wikidata Linked Data Service (optional): This online database supports the creation of linkable agent and subject data for archival records. Note that while wikidata is not considered an “authorized” source by national best practices, its vast controlled vocabulary can be linked to authorized sources and to wiki-content to significantly expand accessibility of archival records. This database can be accessed online at: www.wikidata.org.</li> 
<li>Collection Identification Guide: This guide created by the Preservation Self-Assessment Program allows archivist a variety of tools to identify and preserve analog and audiovisual media types. This guide can be accessed at: https://psap.library.illinois.edu/collection-id-guide.</li> 
<li>PREMIS Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata: The PREMIS Data Dictionary is the international standard to support the preservation of digital archival materials. This guide can be accessed at: https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/v3/premis-3-0-final.pdf.</li>
<li>Housing and Material Specifications Guide: This guidance from the National Archives provides guidance for archivists on how to stabilize and address preservation storage needs for archival materials. The guidelines can be accessed at: https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/specs-housing-exhibition-2015-current.html.</li>
<li>Archival Supplies and Containers: Archival supplies are available in the HS-LIB 0005 and in the Archives Center Reading Room for general use. Specialized supplies can also be ordered on demand.

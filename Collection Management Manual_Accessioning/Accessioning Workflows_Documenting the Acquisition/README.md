<h1>Accession Workflows: Documenting the Acquisition of Materials</h1>

<p>After analyzing the collection and stabilizing any immediate preservation needs, archivists have enough information to create an accession record. The accession record is a critical tool for the long-term maintenance of collection. As a group, the archives accession records provide all of the relevant information about how the archives obtained its collections, the legal terms of those acquisitions, the contents of those acquisitions, and the locations of those materials for long-term storage and retrieval.</p> 
<p>The Archives Center maintains these accession records in a “collection management system” which stores the information as a dataset. By storing these records as data, archivists can create aggregate reports on the collection as a whole and effectively maintain all of the collections at scale. The Shelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center uses ArchivesSpace collection management software to create, access, and work with our local accession records.</p>  
<p>In order to ensure that individual accession records consistently conform to the same standards as the larger dataset (and in turn to ensure accurate reporting and aggregation of the data itself), accessioning archivists follow strict guidance on how to consistently create the individual datapoints that comprise each accession record.</p>  
<p>The following rules ensure the consistency and usability of this data as a whole so it is crucial for archivists accessioning to use the below charts to ensure the accession record data for each sub-record or part of the record conforms to this guidance.</p>

<h1>Accessioning Workflows: Reviewing New Acquisitions</h1>

<p>Acquisition and accession are likely the only points in the lifecycle of archival documents that archivists have easy and direct access to the creators, donors, and/or sources of the materials. Access to collection creators is an important tool for archivists: access allows archivists to ask critical questions concerning the contents, condition, and context of the materials that may otherwise require hours of labor-intensive (and expensive) research later in the process. In order to take advantage of this unique time, archivists should accession and document newly acquired materials as quickly as possible following acquisition.</p> 

<p>To do so, archivists must begin the workflow by surveying and analyzing the newly acquired materials to determine what information is known about the collection and what information needs to be discovered in order to move forward. During the survey, an accessioning archivist is expected to establish intellectual, legal, and physical control of the materials. This process will require that archivists survey both administration documentation created during the acquisition of materials and the materials themselves.</p> 

<p>In order to facilitate a thorough survey, archivists should ensure that they can answer the following questions about a new acquisition:</p>
<ol>
<li>(Legal Control) Did the archivist that acquired this material create adequate legal documentation to establish how it was acquired, the legal terms of the acquisition, and the terms under which the material may be accessed or used? 

Is there a vendor invoice, deed of gift, or a transfer receipt that documents that the creator legally sold, donated, or transferred this material to archive? If so, on what date did this occur and what office or individual gave permission for this transaction? Did the office or creator provide any terms governing this transaction? Did the office or creator include any restrictions on use or access to the materials?</li> 

<li>(Intellectual Control) Is there any existing information that documents the contents and condition of this collection? 

Does the invoice/deed of gift/transfer receipt include a collection or record group title that explains if this is a new collection or an addition to an existing collection? Does the acquisition documentation include an inventory or listing of the contents of the collection? If so, does the inventory include key information about the formats or types of material in the collection and/or the important people, events, and/or dates documented by the collection? If so, are there any materials or subjects that might include sensitive or restricted contents and/or damaged materials?</li> 
<li>(Physical Control) Is there any existing information that helps document the physical requirements of the collection?

Can you determine the collectionâ€™s size in preferred units of measure (i.e., linear feet, items, and/or GB)? Does the physical collection have any existing conditions which would compromise its long-term preservation (i.e., pest, water damage, or active mold)? Is the collection stored in appropriate housing (i.e., archival quality storage containers and acid-free folders)? Does the archive have the appropriate amount of climate-controlled storage space to properly steward this material?</li>  
</ol>
